My first Samsung Phone",16/01/2024,"Every time I need a new phone I try a new brand.This time it was Samsung's turn.Pros:Nice screenSamsung UI is very similar to Apple (I had an iPhone)which means very nice.Cons:Very poor battery life.Fingerprint scanner turns off.I need to charge this phone every day.I have never had a new phone that I needed to do that to.I even turned off the 120 Hz screen. Didnt make a difference.I setup phone to use fingerprint scanner when screen is off.After phone as been idle a few hours, every time I go to use scanner.Its no longer there, I have to use my 4 digit pin to get in phone.After using the phone and turning it off the scanner is back again.This phone costs too much for things like this to happen.On just a 5 watt charger this phone charges real fast.My experience has been when that happens the battery is old and failing.This is the way all my other phones worked.They took a long time to charge when new.Next phone I need I'm not sure what brand Ill buy.As poor as the battery is in this one it might be sooner than later.

Just OK Phone",06/08/2023,"This is my first Samsung phone, but we do use Samsung tablets that we really like.  I did not want to replace our phones; the older Motorola and Lg phones were wonderful, but I got really sick of the vendors not updating them after two years.  That, and around 3 years in, the phones always seem to start developing mysterious issues that they never had before (e.g, needing frequent restarts to get the audio to work) - just like the vendor is trying to force you to buy something new.  I really do not like that.The main draw here, besides good ratings, was the promise that the software would be updated for FOUR years.I'm not really all that impressed.  Maybe it is just getting used to something different, but I do find many things missing compared to the same priced phones from Motorola and LG.  For example, the phone does not have a proximity detector or a metal detector, and the disgusting nag software that is included from Samsung really ticks me off.  Taking a long time to weed it out.  There are some nice new features too, so it is not all bad, just not as good as I had expected.One of the most irritating things is that you often cannot just tap a ""button""; instead, you have to hold on it and swipe some direction.  Two really annoying places this shows up is when the phone rings, and you have two buttons available - one to answer and one to reject.  No instructions on the screen at all, but neither button works unless you tap/hold/swipe Up.  My Motorola phone shows just one button, and you swipe up to answer and down to reject, but the key is that it TELLS you that right on the screen!Another even worse situation is when the calendar sends you an alert, and the big ""Dismiss"" button on the bottom does NOTHING at all!  I am still not sure what works to actually dismiss those alerts - after a few minutes of tapping, screaming, cussing, etc., I just hide the phone under a pillow and leave the room.  I do not know if any of these issues are specific to all Samsung phones or just this A54, but either way it makes me wish I  had not bought it.

It only comes with an eSim",09/01/2024,"When I ordered the phone it said it came with both an eSim card and a regular Sim card but it only came with an eSim.  This was quite a hastle as my carrier only activates IPhone eSim cards and not android.  I had to order and pay for a physical Sim card but it took several days to get it.  What a pain.  If I had known this I would not have purchased it.

Exynos Processor Ruins This Phone. Heat",06/12/2023,"This is an A series phone from samsung and it has Exynos processor. I didn't have any issues with Bluetooth or Wi-Fi connectivity as reported by other users. The heat issue with Exynos as a processor is real and it certainly affects the life of the phone. If you can get this phone for less than $350 it's ok. Any price higher than that is absolutely unjustified. If you're spending that much, just get an S series phone or go to ebay for an older flagship. I have to mention the size, this phone is a small tablet. Any phone surpassing 6.1 is a tablet, making this phone a ""phablet"".TLDR: Phone gets hot, it's huge and randomly freezes momentarily. Exynos is a terrible processor. Don't pay more than $350 for this phone.

Great phone but it comes with so much bloatware and telemetry spyware, but it can be removed",24/07/2023,"The phone itself is pretty decent but because it's not a flagship phone it feels cheap and I worry that if I ever drop it, it will break. But my previous phone, S6, was rugged, thin and capable of being dropped without worry. I bought two of these on prime day, one of them had been opened before because there was a sticker removed from the box and there was a very small scratch on the screen. I really don't want to deal with replacing it so I kept it. The phone does not come with a charger! It says it in the description so be sure you buy a USB-C with the right wattage.As far as the bloatware and spyware goes, it comes with a lot of it. You will need to download a program called ""platform tools"" to get rid of it. There are a lot of youtube videos and instructions available on how to use it and what to remove. But if you do this, you will have a quality phone that doesn't do creepy things without your consent. The battery was draining pretty quickly before I did this as well, so you must do this part. This is a requirement for almost any phone you get.I spent 4 days without needing to charge my phone with light use. It was about 30%. So the battery is pretty reasonable. Get a screen protector, USB-C charger with appropriate wattage and if you must, a protective case. The USB cable is very short, if you need longer consider getting one as well.

Phone unlocks randomly in your pocket",15/11/2023,"Pros: The phone is fast. It's a good deal for a budget phone. IT COMES WITH AN SD CARD SLOT! The camera is really nice. I can put tons of apps on here and not have to worry about space.Cons: TONS of unnecessary in-your-face bloatware. I mean tons. Even if you are texting Samsung tries to get in your face. This will be my last Samsung Product. If you buy this, you will spend hours uninstalling crap and Samsung will still ask you to store your passwords or use their cloud. It's unacceptable and I absolutely regret this purchase. I gave Samsung one more chance and they burned me.To be fair, it's not Samsung's fault. I knew what they were about and went with them anyway, because I wanted the SD card. Which it does have!! (Hence 2 stars)The worst part is the screen unlocks randomly. Think about that. If my phone is protected by face recognition, fingerprint, and PIN how is it unlocking in my pocket? If someone wants to break into my phone and steal my info all they have to do is put my phone in their pocket and walk around? Not acceptable. It's an invasion of my privacy.I work nights, someone I haven't talked to in 10 years received 4 random texts from me at 3:30 AM. That was embarrassing.Don't go with Samsung. They are worse than Apple at this point.

It's okay.",17/08/2023,"My old phone was the galaxy S10e. Very basic phone, nothing fancy. However that phone was durable and well made. This phone is cheaply made. Feels like cheap plastic, easily slips out of hand if you don't have a phone case on it. It's a thicker phone so when it vibrates you hear the echo thru the phone. Seems to lag a lot especially when you've been using it for a while. Overheats easily. Also the screen seems to have a mind of it's own. If your just reading something suddenly your phone will be going to the webpage from an ad without you touching anything. The pros are good battery life so far. And it's a 5g phone. I guess the price to because I don't need a $1000+ dollar phone I just need the basics. But compared to my last phone the quality is definitely lacking. Lastly this phone isn't huge but it's a lot bigger than my last phone so holding it with one hand can definitely be uncomfortable after a while so a phone case and ring to hold the phone are a must.

Overall Disappointed",23/12/2023,"My wife and I bought these phones as replacements for our 2 year old Pixel 5a phones after her 5a died. I used this phone for a week before returning it due to all the issues I was experiencing with it. I used it on a week of work travel so I got to experience it in variety of environments, including at home. I found the A54 to be very glitchy, lots of problems getting apps to work correctly or at all. Spotify would play 2-4 songs and then freeze, I would have to restart the app before it would work again. My American Airlines app glitched out, wouldn't load boarding passes and refused to work until I restarted the phone, almost missed my flight on that one. Many issues with Google maps. No amount of phone restarts or app reinstalls seemed to correct any of these issues. The camera was extremely disappointing, the pictures were honestly terrible compared to my 2 year old pixel. I will say the display brightness, clarity and 120hz refresh were excellent.Maybe I got a lemon, but overall switching back to my old pixel 5a, my 2 year old pixel feels like a much better phone to me.

I sent it back.........",18/11/2023,"I didn't like ANYTHING about this device.  It's slow and cumbersome.  Samsung should actually be embarrassed.  I know I sure was when I received it!  That Exynos chip?  SUCKS big time!  I can't believe that a 3 year old phone is faster than this brand new 2023 model.Downsides?  All of them.  This doesn't support memory cards.  Seems that Samsung wants us to use their cloud, which I refuse to do.  I already have enough problems with Google Photos and Microsoft OneDrive, I don't need my pictures in yet another ""cloud"" where anyone in the company can have access to them.Slow, slow, slow.  That's what you get with an Exynos chip.  I hope they move on from that and use the Snapdragon chips.I had this phone for about 45 minutes before I came here to Amazon to request a return.  Yep, that's how bad it is.I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS HANDSET FOR A PRIMARY CELL PHONE.

Repeatedly Drops WiFi 6 Connection",02/08/2023,"I use WiFi most of the time and my WiFi access is WiFi 6. WiFi 6 has been around since 2019 so it is hardly a new technology. The A54 5G repeatedly drops WiFi 6 connections even though all of my other phones hold it stable. I tried all of the usual remedies: Updates, Factory Reset, More Updates, different SIM, tried another A54 5G, nada, no joy! In most other respects the phone performed well. I found an article on the internet that the very same problem with WiFi 6 was happening with the S23 series. The article was several months old and one of the other phones I have is an S23 Plus and it held its connection to WiFi 6 stable. So it is possible that in a few months, this problem might be fixed in some kind of update. But for now, I had to return the phone.

Great screen, good camera but slow charging but heavy and bulky with case",12/07/2023,"I have came back to Samsung after 2+ years with a OnePlus. I mainly got sick of the bad camera on the OnePlus so the return to Samsung solved that issue. The immediate value is on the fabulous screen and pleasant interface. The sound quality is also great although no traditional headphone jack was a bummer. The interface is pleasant but I personally like OnePlus better in ways. The camera is good but I would fault the focus and the image detail isn't like say an iPhone. The biggest downsides are the very slow charging and the bulk of the phone. It was like going backwards 2 or 3 years compared to my super fast charging and lightweight OnePlus. By the time you put this phone in a decent case it's a real heavy chunk.

Face unlock/ fingerprint unlock",19/08/2023,"The facial ID and fingerprint unlock is extremely slow and unreliable. More times than not, my phone tells me my face isn't recognized or my fingerprint won't work. Unlocking the phone in general is laggy. This phone overall has issues will lag, but the most frustrating is the amount of time it takes to unlock the phone. I upgraded from the samsung s10e which has the fingerprint sensor on the side and it is 10x faster unlocking. The face ID is much more responsive as well. I wish I stuck with my s10e.

Camera is BAD, don't buy & Basic LED notification and standard features non existent. Disappointed",02/12/2023,"The camera is soo bad (see side by side comparison from my old samsung and this model.) Additionally,  I work and sometimes cannot open my phone to see notifications.  Old Samsung had a basic LED light to indicate a missed call or text I could see at just a glance.  With this phone I literally have to open the phone, select the app and hope I haven't missed an important text or voicemail.  My mother is ill and while I'm at work I need to know if there is an emergency. This phone completely leaves that emergency notice to chance.  Very disappointing! Searching for something more reliable now.

This Samsung Galaxy A54 arrived with a battery that won't hold a charge for more than about 4 hours",08/07/2023,"This is the first time I've splurged and bought a genuine Samsung Galaxy. I expected to be delighted, and I was at first. The phone lived up to the hype I'd read in reviews. Bright , colorful screen, good cameras, efficient design. But by the time I finished setting it up, I realized the battery was draining super fast. I can't use the phone for more than 3 or 4 hours before the battery drains. I called Samsung, and a very helpful technician diagnosed by remote control, concluding nothing was wrong in software or settings, suggesting the battery must be defective.That where the helpfulness ended. Neither Samsung nor Amazon will replace the phone. Samsung washes their hands of responsibility short of directing me to a location an hour away where a technician might be able to repair the phone. Of course, repair is unacceptable. I ordered a new, perfect phone, and that's what I deserve to have. There's supposed to be a 14-day replacement policy, according to Samsung, but I have to get that from Amazon. Amazon will not replace the phone, saying only, ""we don't have that option in our system."" They want me to mail it back and have it ""evaluated by a technician"" for possible refund of replacement. Imagine my shock that they won't just send me a new phone.I called Samsung back, and they refuse to help in any way. They aren't even listening to me. I just spent 20 minutes telling a customer care rep the whole story (for the tenth time) and even though I specified repeatedly that I bought the phone from Amazon, he ended the call by telling me one of the reasons he couldn't help me is that he doesn't know from whom I bought the phone. Needless to say, I will never buy another Samsung product. I can also say I'm dismayed and angry that Amazon doesn't have my back. I've spent hours on the phone today trying to have a defective phone replaced, and I've got nothing to show for it, other than a defective phone that won't hold a charge.

Unreliable Phone",15/11/2023,"This phone is the first phone we have owned that has caused us repeated grief. Although we have owned many Samsung phones and enjoyed their durability and dependability, this phone is different. From the beginning we have had problems with the phone not receiving calls and texts. And though you hope an update might fix these issues, they have persisted. So, it is time to contact Samsung (because I am past the date of returning it to Amazon) to see if I can get a replacement, or even better, an upgrade to a better phone.
